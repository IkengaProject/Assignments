Hey you there! Hello there fellow pokemon trainer! I can see you have quite a pokemon team you have there!
On your way to becoming a pokemon master? Trying to catch all the pokemon?
Back in my day, all it took was defeating eight gym leaders, the elite four, and the pokemon champion.
But now you got over 700+ Pokemon to catch, how can you keep track of it all? Well, that's you're lucky here.
Although I can not help you with your trainer skills, I can help you with keeping track of pokemon information.
This is the first (and totaly original) worlds first complete Pokedex! <br>
<br>
What is a Pokedex you say? Well, a Pokedex is a digital library of all information of all the Pokemon.
Originally, a handheld portable pokemon library and data gatherer, where you had to gather the data yourself one by one from encounters, it is now avaliable online for the first time ever!
