<h1> Retro Anime </h1>
<p1> Japanese animation is no different than those are found in the western world. Just like how earlier Disney animation were each scenes and drawings where drawn by hand and where capture frame by frame, Japanese anime also adapted this method during its infancy. Japanese animator pioneer Osamu Tezuka revolutionzed Japanese animation in the 1960s in which he adapted many of Disney's animation techinqiues such as limited animation in which animators would reuse already drawn backgrounds and characters for other frames in order to reduce the amount of animation cells that needs to be drawn. Osamu also expanded upon Disney's techinique and created a distinction that makes it's unique. While Disney animators emphasizes their drawings more on movements, Japanese animators prioritize the art quality of their characters and scenery and reuse many of the scenery background images as well as reusable stock characters to help enhance the animation at a much lower cost. This in turn creates a production in which main characters are easily recognizable due to the high quality of the art while also still allows for movements from scene to scene. </p1>

<p2> Earlier Japanese anime were predominantly science fiction. Anime titles such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Neon Evangelion, and Akira are very distinct to the Scifi that shown on the west because many of the technology that are introduced within these titles gave rise to what is called "real robots" or "mecha" genre. Unlike their western counterparts, Japanese scifi introduced technology concepts that are extremely close to reality and is feasibile given enough time and research. Mobile Suit Gundam is such a series in which many of the future technology used in the show follows the basic law of physics while also explainining in great details via through the lore in which such technology can be achieved in the real world. </p2>

<p3> The 1990s is also the era in which anime became popular in the western world and was shown in a larger audience outside of Japan. Series such as Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and Cowboy Beepop entered the world stage in which they were even dubbed in many parts of the world and have their own localized production group just to help broadcast them in their respective territories. For example, it is estimated that the cost of localizing an anime show within an English speaking country can cost well over $10,000 per episode. This in turn makes localization from different parts of the world profitable as they don't have to shoulder the full burden of the animation process and only need to edit out the voices as well as minor changes to compily with broadcasting policies in their respective countries. As a refference, the Japanese studio ufotable indicated that it cost the company $80,000 to produce one episode of Demon Slayer. Countries from across the world only needs to pay for licensing fee as well as staff and voice actors to broadcast the anime in their jurisdiction.
