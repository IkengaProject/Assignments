<h1>Modern Anime</h1>
<p>On contast to old anime which each frame is drawn onto a cell and printed, <br>
modern anime uses computer generated graphics. This method allows animator to <br>
animate more smoothly and higher quality frames. some fans perfer the old anime <br>
as they offer unique design per studio showing the artists talent and diversity <br>
as opposed digital animation, which most of it is gone.
