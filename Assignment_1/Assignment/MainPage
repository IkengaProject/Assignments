<p>Welcome weebs and otakus alike! Welcome to the Mordern or Old Anime website.
As our name implies, this discuss the topic of anime what does its age mean.
When we refer "age", what we mean is the year ther anime came out in Japan.
Anime itself an animation style that comes form the country of Japan.
Anime's history can be traced back over 100 years ago, back in 1917.
With over a 100 year history, how can one determine what is considered old?
One could say that just put it in the middle and call it a day, but its much more complex than that.
Every decade or so, a new generation and evolution of the industry changtes drastiucally.
Whether its from art style, plot, view angles, and much more. To make things simple, this website decided to define "old" as the indivdual anime being more than 10 years.
We have handy tool that can also tell you if an anime is old. Just type in the year and give it ago.      </p>
