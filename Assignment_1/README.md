## Manny's Assignment
1. Using for loops find the largest number in an array
`let largestNum = function (num) {
  // Insert code here
  }`
- Example usage: largestNum([2,1,7,2]) should return 7
2. Write a function that replaces the number 6 in an array with the letter 'x'
`let sixToX = function(array) {
  // Insert code here
  }`
- Example usage: sixToX([1,2,6,3,6]) = [1,2,'x', 3, 'x']
sixToX([1,2,3]) = [1,2, 3]
